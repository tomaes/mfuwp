"music for underwater people" interface and player 


WHAT IT IS

- This is a so-called "musicdisk" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicdisk).
- Simply put, it's a custom, interactive, music player written for a specific music album, compilation or EP.
- This is the source of the player/interface part of such a musicdisk.

- You can download a binary package for windows here:
  ftp://ftp.scene.org/pub/music/disks/tomaes-musicforunderwaterpeople_musicdisk_edition-win32.zip

- the original EP release is also available at archive.org:
  http://archive.org/details/music_for_underwater_people

REQUIREMENTS

- Java Virtual Machine Runtime. 
- Processing 1.5.x and GLGraphics 1.0 to compile and run inside the Processing IDE.
- The actual music and graphics are not part of this source release, so you'd need those too.
